### Web app created on Ruby on Rails with MVC structure.
http://rent-a-puppy.herokuapp.com/

Created in a team of 4 developers in Le Wagon Code Bootcamp. 

### Functionality

- authentication
- list a posting about a puppy
- remove a listing from the database
- make a reservation for a listing and "book" a puppy



### What I learned

This app was made as a fast prototype and such has dedign for the desktop. 
In the future it is wise to start the design with mobile-first design.
